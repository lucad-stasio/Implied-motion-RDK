# Implied-motion-RDK
This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of a Random Dot Kinematogram (RDK), a classic visual stimulus used in neuroscience and psychology to study motion perception. This project is built as a plugin for the JsPsych library, allowing for easy integration into web-based behavioral experiments.
